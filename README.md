This is a demonstration of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, which allows you to upload PDF files. 
Using this system, you can receive answers from GPT that are specifically based on the content of the uploaded PDF. 
If the information is not found in the PDF, GPT will provide an answer independently.
